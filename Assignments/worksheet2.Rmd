```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(diagram)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(reshape2)
library(curl)
library(brms)

mycols <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")

pdmdat <- curl("https://tinyurl.com/dataBayesCogMod")
pdm <- read.csv(pdmdat)

bayes_lmext <- brm(RT ~ N200_latencies*N200_amplitudes, data=pdm)

bayes_anova <- brm(RT ~ factor(condition)*factor(accuracy), data=pdm)

bayes_final <- brm(RT ~ (1|subject) + N200_latencies*N200_amplitudes, data=pdm)

```

## We will again use the PDM data set, but with some different variables. You can load it using the following code in `R`:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(curl) 
```

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
# See https://github.com/mdnunez/encodingN200 for more information about the data
pdmdat <- curl("https://tinyurl.com/dataBayesCogMod")
pdm <- read.csv(pdmdat)
```

## 1. (10min) What is the brms code to estimate a linear regression with *RT* as the dependent variable, *N200_latencies* and *N200_amplitudes* as the independent variables, and *an interaction term*?

The `summary()` should provide something like the output on the next page.

\newpage

```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
summary(bayes_lmext)
```

## 2. (5min) What effects are significant in this model?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
bayes_anova <- brm(RT ~ factor(condition)*factor(accuracy), data=pdm)
summary(bayes_anova)
```

```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
summary(bayes_anova)
```

\newpage

## 3. (10min) What is the brms code to estimate a linear regression with *RT* as the dependent variable, *N200_latencies* and *N200_amplitudes* as the independent variables, an *interaction term*, and a random intercept for each *subject*?

The `summary()` should output something like this:

```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
summary(bayes_final)
```
